Network Security Threats Report
🛡️ Introduction

Network security threats are malicious activities designed to disrupt, steal, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer networks and data. As organizations rely heavily on the internet for communication and operations, these threats have become more sophisticated and frequent. Understanding these attacks and how to prevent them is essential for maintaining data integrity, availability, and confidentiality.

🚫 1. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks
➤ How It Works
A Denial of Service (DoS) attack floods a target system (usually a server or website) with excessive traffic, overwhelming its resources and rendering it unavailable to legitimate users. Attackers may use botnets (networks of infected machines) in “Distributed DoS (DDoS)” attacks to increase the scale.

➤ Real-World Examples
- GitHub DDoS Attack (2018): GitHub experienced one of the largest DDoS attacks ever recorded (1.35 Tbps) using  “memcached servers”  to amplify traffic.
- Dyn DNS Attack (2016): Took down major services like Twitter, Netflix, and Reddit using the Mirai botnet.

➤ Impact
- Downtime for services and websites
- Revenue loss for businesses
- Damage to brand reputation
- Exhaustion of network resources

➤ Prevention and Mitigation
- Use of  firewalls and intrusion detection systems
- Rate limiting  to control traffic flow
- CDN and load balancers to absorb attacks
- Employing ‘anti-DDoS services’ like Cloudflare, Akamai

🕵️‍♂️ 2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

➤ How It Works
In MITM attacks, the attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties (like a user and a website) without their knowledge. This can happen via “Wi-Fi eavesdropping”, “DNS spoofing”, or “SSL stripping”.

➤ Real-World Examples
- Superfish Adware (2015): Lenovo devices shipped with pre-installed software that enabled MITM attacks by using self-signed root certificates.
- WiFi Pineapple Attacks: Hackers set up rogue Wi-Fi hotspots to sniff data from connected users.

➤ Impact
- Theft of sensitive information (login credentials, credit card numbers)
- Session hijacking and identity theft
- Unauthorized access to private communications

➤ Prevention and Mitigation
- Use of “HTTPS and SSL/TLS encryption”
- Avoid connecting to “public/unknown Wi-Fi”
- Implement “VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)”
- Enable “two-factor authentication (2FA)”

 
🎭 3. Spoofing Attacks

➤ Types of Spoofing
- IP Spoofing: Attacker sends packets using a fake IP address.
- Email Spoofing: Falsified sender address in emails to trick recipients.
- DNS Spoofing: Redirects a domain name to a malicious IP.

➤ How It Works
Spoofing tricks users or systems into believing false identities. For example, in “DNS spoofing”, a user might type `www.bank.com` but get redirected to a fake phishing website due to altered DNS records.

➤ Real-World Examples
- MyDoom Worm (2004): Used email spoofing to spread malware.
- Comodo Hack (2011): Attackers used spoofed IPs to issue fake SSL certificates for high-profile domains.

➤ Impact
- Redirection to malicious websites
- Spread of malware or ransomware
- Breach of sensitive data
- Loss of user trust

➤ Prevention and Mitigation
- Use “email authentication protocols” like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC
- Deploy “firewalls and packet filtering”
- Regular “DNS cache poisoning checks”
- Educate users on “phishing awareness”

📌 Conclusion

Cybersecurity threats such as DoS, MITM, and Spoofing continue to evolve, making it critical for individuals and organizations to stay informed and proactive. By understanding how these attacks work and implementing preventive measures, we can significantly reduce their impact and protect our networks from compromise.
