üî• Basic Firewall Configuration Using UFW

üßæ What This Script Does

This script configures a basic firewall on a Linux system using **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)**.  
It performs the following actions:

- Allows SSH traffic on port 22 (to ensure remote access is not blocked).
- Denies HTTP traffic on port 80 (as a basic security measure).
- Displays the current status of the firewall with all active rules.

üîê Why SSH is Allowed and HTTP is Denied

- **SSH (Port 22)** is allowed so that secure remote access remains possible, especially for system administrators.
- **HTTP (Port 80)** is denied in this example to simulate restricting access to web services. This can be useful if a web server is misconfigured or under maintenance.
